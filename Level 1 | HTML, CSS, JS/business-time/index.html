            <span>NICE TO MICHE!</span>
            <p>The introduction of Charlie's Michelada Mix comes after years of thoughtful 
                consideration, research, and trial. <br> We only made this leap of faith knowing that the 
                taste met our high standards and yours. <br>While our taste testing required a few late nights, 
                we were willing to make the sacrifice. (Tough job but somebody had to do it!)</p>
